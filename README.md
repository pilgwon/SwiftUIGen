# SwiftUIGen

## Purpose

Generate Xcode project with pre-set settings.

## Problem

To start new Xcode project, there's too many settings to do.

Here's the setting list.

* 🎉 Generate Xcode project
* 🚚 Moving files and renaming folders
* 🙈 Adding .gitignore file
* 🚨 Adding SwiftLint
* 🍱 Adding SwiftGen
* 🛠 Adding Fastlane
* ➕ Adding Dependencies (SPM, Carthage or CocoaPods)

## To Do

Happy path of this automation is create yml file and run just one command. (like `Fastlane`'s `Fastfile` or `XcodeGen`'s `project.yml`)

1. Create and upload Xcode project template
2. Automate each actions in Problem section
3. Write script for just one command

## Why `SwiftUI`?

If not specifying SwiftUI, another problems come.

I'll only use SwiftUI which means I'll concentrate on delicious codes.

## Documentation

There's no documents yet.
